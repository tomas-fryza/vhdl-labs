## Part 1: Finite State Machine (FSM)

A **Finite State Machine (FSM)** is a mathematical model used to describe and represent the behavior of systems that can be in a finite number of states at any given time. It consists of a set of states, transitions between these states, and actions associated with these transitions.

The main properties of using FSMs include:

   1. **Determinism**: FSMs are deterministic if, for each state and input, there is exactly one transition to a next state. This property simplifies analysis and implementation.

   2. **State Memory**: FSMs inherently have memory as they retain information about their current state. This allows them to model systems with sequential behavior.

   3. **Simplicity**: FSMs are relatively simple and intuitive to understand, making them useful for modeling and designing systems with discrete and sequential behavior.

   4. **Parallelism**: FSMs can represent parallelism by having multiple state machines working concurrently, each handling different aspects of the system.

The main types of FSMs include Moore Machine and Mealy Machine. In a **Moore machine**, outputs are associated with states (see [figure](https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/technical-articles/implementing-a-finite-state-machine-in-vhdl/) bellow), while in a **Mealy machine**, outputs are associated with transitions between states. This means that Moore machines produce outputs only after transitioning to a new state, while Mealy machines can produce outputs immediately upon receiving an input.

   ![Moore-type FSM](images/diagram_moore_structure.png)

One widely used method to illustrate a finite state machine is through a **state diagram**, comprising circles connected by directed arcs. Each circle denotes a machine state labeled with its name, and, in the case of a Moore machine, an [output value](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-004-computation-structures-spring-2017/c6/c6s1/) associated with the state.

   ![State diagrams](images/diagram_circle.png)

Directed arcs signify the transitions between states in a finite state machine (FSM). For a Mealy machine, these arcs are labeled with input/output pairs, while for a Moore machine, they are labeled solely with inputs.

## Part 2: Basics of UART communication

The UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) is not a communication protocol like SPI and I2C, but a physical circuit in a microcontroller, or a stand-alone integrated circuit, that translates communicated data between serial and parallel forms. It is one of the simplest and easiest method for implement and understanding.

In UART communication, two UARTs communicate directly with each other. The transmitting UART converts parallel data from a CPU into serial form, transmits it in serial to the receiving UART, which then converts the serial data back into parallel data for the receiving device. Only two wires are needed to transmit data between two UARTs. Data flows from the Tx pin of the transmitting UART to the Rx pin of the receiving UART: [link](https://www.circuitbasics.com/basics-uart-communication/), [link](https://www.analog.com/en/analog-dialogue/articles/uart-a-hardware-communication-protocol.html).

UARTs transmit data asynchronously, which means there is no external clock signal to synchronize the output of bits from the transmitting UART. Instead, timing is agreed upon in advance between both units, and special **Start** (log. 0) and 1 or 2 **Stop** (log. 1) bits are added to each data package. These bits define the beginning and end of the data packet so the receiving UART knows when to start reading the bits. In addition to the start and stop bits, the packet/frame also contains data bits and optional parity.

The amount of **data** in each packet can be set from 5 to 9 bits. If it is not otherwise stated, data is transferred least-significant bit (LSB) first.

**Parity** is a form of very simple, low-level error checking and can be Even or Odd. To produce the parity bit, add all 5-9 data bits and extend them to an even or odd number. For example, assuming parity is set to even and was added to a data byte `0110_1010`, which has an even number of 1's (4), the parity bit would be set to 0. Conversely, if the parity mode was set to odd, the parity bit would be 1.

One of the most common UART formats is called **9600 8N1**, which means 8 data bits, no parity, 1 stop bit and a symbol rate of 9600&nbsp;Bd.

## Part 3: UART Transmitter in VHDL

1. Run Vivado, create a new project and implement an FSM version of UART transmitter 8N1 with clock enable and reset:

   1. Project name: `uart`
   2. Project location: your working folder, such as `Documents`
   3. Project type: **RTL Project**
   4. Create a VHDL source file: `uart_tx_8n1`
   5. Do not add any constraints now
   6. Choose a default board: `Nexys A7-50T`
   7. Click **Finish** to create the project
   8. Define I/O ports of new module:

      | **Port name** | **Direction** | **Type** | **Description** |
      | :-: | :-: | :-- | :-- |
      | `clk`      | input  | `std_logic` | Main clock |
      | `rst`      | input  | `std_logic` | High-active synchronous reset |
      | `baud_en`  | input  | `std_logic` | Clock Enable signal (Baud tick) |
      | `tx_start` | input  | `std_logic` | Start transmission |
      | `data_in`  | input  | `std_logic_vector(7 downto 0)` | Data to transmit |
      | `tx` | output | `std_logic` | UART Tx line |
      | `tx_done` | output | `std_logic` | Transmission completed |

2. Define four states for the FSM and an internal counter in the architecture declaration section to count a sequence of data bits.

    ```vhdl
    architecture behavioral of uart_tx_8n1 is
        -- FSM States
        type   state_type is (IDLE, START_BIT, DATA, STOP_BIT);
        signal state_tx : state_type;

        -- Transmission Registers
        signal sig_count : integer range 0 to 7;
        signal sig_reg   : std_logic_vector(7 downto 0);
    begin
        ...
    ```

3. Complete the architecture body section according to the following template.

    ```vhdl
    begin

        -- UART Transmitter FSM
        p_uart_tx_8n1 : process (clk) is
        begin

            if rising_edge(clk) then
                if (rst = '1') then
                    -- Reset state to IDLE, set Tx to 1

                    -- Reset sig_count to 0 and tx_done to 0

                elsif (baud_en = '1') then  -- Use clock enable signal

                    case state_tx is

                        when IDLE =>
                            -- Keep Tx line to high

                            -- Clear tx_done to 0

                            if (tx_start = '1') then
                                state_tx <= START_BIT;
                            end if;

                        when START_BIT =>
                            -- Start bit (LOW), Load data to transmit
                            tx        <= '0';
                            sig_reg   <= data_in;
                            sig_count <= 0;
                            tx_done   <= '0';
                            state_tx  <= DATA;

                        when DATA =>
                            tx      <=  -- Transmit LSB first
                            sig_reg <=  -- Shift register to right
                            if (sig_count = 7) then
                                state_tx <= STOP_BIT;
                            else
                                sig_count <= sig_count + 1;
                            end if;

                        when STOP_BIT =>
                            -- Set Tx stop bit (HIGH)

                            -- Set tx_done to 1

                            -- Set next state to IDLE

                        when others =>
                            state_tx <= IDLE;

                    end case;

                end if;
            end if;

        end process p_uart_tx_8n1;

    end architecture behavioral;
    ```

4. Use **Flow > Open Elaborated design** and see the schematic after RTL analysis.

## Part 4: Top level VHDL code

1. Create a VHDL design source named `top_level`. Implement a button-triggered UART transmitter on the Nexys A7 board to send data to your computer via the serial line. The transmitted data will be specified using the 8 switches `SW[7:0]` to input ASCII codes, which you can look up on this [ASCII code chart](https://www.ascii-code.com/).

   ![top level](images/top-level_ver1.png)

   > **Notes:**
   > * The `clock_en` component from the previous lab(s) is required. Do not forget to copy both files to `YOUR-PROJECT-FOLDER/uart.srcs/sources_1/new/` folder and add them to the project or use **Copy scripts to project** checkbox while adding design source file in Vivado.
   > * Your transmitter signal `tx` must be connected to onboard FTDI FT2232HQ USB-UART bridge receiver, ie. use pin number `D4` which is maped in XDC template to `UART_RXD_OUT` (see [Nexys A7 reference manual, section 6](https://digilent.com/reference/programmable-logic/nexys-a7/reference-manual?redirect=1)).
   
2. Use online template for your [constraints XDC](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Digilent/digilent-xdc/master/Nexys-A7-50T-Master.xdc) file `nexys` and uncomment the used pins according to the `top_level` entity.

3. Run Putty or any other serial monitor application or [web application](https://hhdsoftware.com/online-serial-port-monitor). Set the **Connection type** to `Serial`, specify your **Serial line** (e.g., COM3), set the **Speed** (or Baud Rate), and then click the **Open** button to initiate the communication. Clicking the Up button on the board will transmit the user data selected by the switches.

## Challenges

1. In the `*.xdc` constraints file, remap the UART outputs to any Pmod port on the Nexys A7 board, and display the UART values on an oscilloscope or logic analyzer.

   ![pmods](images/pmod_table.png)

2. Connect the logic analyzer to your Pmod pins, including GND. Launch the **Logic** analyzer software and start the capture. The Saleae Logic software offers a decoding feature to transform the captured signals into meaningful UART messages. Click the **+ button** in the **Analyzers** section and set up the **Async Serial** decoder.

   ![Logic analyzer -- Paris](images/analyzer_paris.png)

   > **Note:** To perform this analysis, you will need a logic analyzer such as [Saleae](https://www.saleae.com/) or [similar](https://www.amazon.com/KeeYees-Analyzer-Device-Channel-Arduino/dp/B07K6HXDH1/ref=sr_1_6?keywords=saleae+logic+analyzer&qid=1667214875&qu=eyJxc2MiOiI0LjIyIiwicXNhIjoiMy45NSIsInFzcCI6IjMuMDMifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=saleae+%2Caps%2C169&sr=8-6) device. Additionally, you should download and install the [Saleae Logic 1](https://support.saleae.com/logic-software/legacy-software/older-software-releases#logic-1-x-download-links) or [Saleae Logic 2](https://www.saleae.com/downloads/) software on your computer.
